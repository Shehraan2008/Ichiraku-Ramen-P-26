## How is Ichiraku Ramen Different and famous from other Ramen.

Ichiraku Ramen is Naruto Uzumaki's (The Protagonist) favourite dining establishment. He eats there regularly – usually stopping by between missions – and he is often joined by Iruka Umino (His Sensie / teacher), another frequent customer. Because Naruto has been a loyal customer for most of his life, Teuchi and his daughter, Ayame, were among the few people in Konoha not to treat Naruto with animosity during his youth which was lonly as people feared that his Nine Tailed Beast Kurama would devour them.

## Birthplace of Ichiraku Ramen in the Manga and Anime

Ramen Ichiraku was founded by Teuchi thirty-one years before the start of the series. Although it is quite small and has an unassuming appearance, Ramen Ichiraku has always been popular with Konoha's villagers because of Teuchi's strong commitment to taste, giving the ramen an almost artistic quality.Like any ramen establishment, Ramen Ichiraku offers various toppings, such as char siu, boiled eggs, narutomaki, menma and seaweed. In Konoha Hiden, seaweed had been the most popular topping for several years until, after the Fourth Shinobi World War, it was surpassed by naruto.
